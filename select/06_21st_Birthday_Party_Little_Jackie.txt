I've stared long enough into the abyss to know there's got to be more than this, it's time to make the metamorphosis like a butterfly bustin out a chrysalis
I've had enough with men my age come on let this cat out the cage cause I'm about to get my cougar on I want em young and dumb, see jane hunt watch dick run
Licky paw washy face, it's time to pick up the pace in the human race, the faster you run the better you place
You can either chase or get chased we in the age of the macho woman and the feminine man everybody know who's wearin the pants

I aint lookin for no millionaire I just want em with a full head of hair, I like my meat rare I swear on my underwear it's just time for me to flat out go there I'll be your cougar baby get in my car, I'll scratch you up but I won't leave a scar, I'll lure you to my den with lollipops and candy bars and we can make plans for your 21st birthday party

Kitty want to play cause men be actin like bitches these days anyways it's like the coming of age roll reversal so controversial, got you captivated like an infomercial
Doubles standards are emphasized only women being criticized by this atypical behavior if you don't like do me a favor and divert your eyes
Kitty kitty hungry it's time to pick up the pace in the human race, the faster you run, the better you place, you can either chase or get chased, we in the age of the macho woman and the feminine man everybody know who leading the dance

Repeat
