Jesus came to my
Birthday party when I
Was seventeen
I thought it was a dream
But I know I've seen him
Standing there
With his long hair
I know I've seen him there
That was a long time ago
And I haven't seen him in a while
Now I'm down in the city and I
Think I've seen him in
The eyes
Of the strangers that pass
In the eyes of the poor
Jesus came to my birthday party
When I was seventeen
It was a long time ago
Jesus came to my birthday party
When I was seventeen
It was a long time ago
Jesus came to my birthday party
I thought it was a dream
But I know I've seen him there
Jesus came to my birthday party
A long time ago
